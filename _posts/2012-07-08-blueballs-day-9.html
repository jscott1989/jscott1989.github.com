<p>Another major shift in the idea of the game. Originally I was going to make something tile based (as I mentioned, based on blue ball machines). But then after playing around with it for a while, I realised that this mechanic isn't very fun. It's a shame because the random level generater was quite fun to work on. Never mind, on to the next idea!</p>

<p>The game is to be a physics based puzzle game where the goal is to get the ball from one side of the room to the other, by building machines to get it there.</p>

<p>Obviously through early versions of the game the machines are going to be simple, about balance, etc. But if I have time before the end of the month I hope to allow for some slightly more crazy machines which rely on the wire being cut which drops a hammer which causes the ruler to fall off the table and send the ball flying towards the exit... or whatever.</p>

<p>I didn't get far yesterday apart from reading about Box2D but today I made some progress. Right now I have the ball starting in a position, and the player can start and reset the scene (turning the physics on and off) - in the final version I expect that everything except for the ball will be moving in the building mode, and everything will be moving in the "playing" mode.</p>

<p>Some good progress today. Tomorrow I hope to get some basic interaction going on. As always, you can see the latest version at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>.</p>
