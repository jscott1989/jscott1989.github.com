<p>Taggr is a project I started while studying at the University of Southampton which aims to bring Facebook-style photo tagging to the open web.</p>

<p>It runs on the Google App Engine with the server coded in Python and the client coded in Javascript using Google Closure Tools.</p>

<p>It has been put on hold for the time being due to other commitments but I do hope to get back to it.</p>
