<p><em>(Note: They didn't really)</em></p>&#13;
<p>Over a year ago I was working on an entry to a gamedev competition where the theme was "I can't ..." and my team chose the theme "I can't spell". The idea was that it would be a sidescrolling platformer set within a story, written by someone who can't spell.</p>&#13;
<p>The gimmick was that the story would unfold as it is narrated (e.g. until the narrator mentions the door, no door is visible on screen). It was also to be fully voice narrated. The main gameplay mechanic was that misspellings would cause an otherwise straightforward pass through a level to become more complicated (e.g. replacing a stake with a steak).</p>&#13;
<p>A video of the early functionality can be seen below (with temporary graphics and narration). Unfortunately my team fell apart and I set the project aside until a couple of weeks ago.</p>&#13;

<p>Recently me and <a href="http://alialo.github.com/" title="Graphic Designer Alan Longstaff">a friend</a> planned to enter the 2012 SomethingAwful GameDev challenge as a team of 2 and as preparation decided to finish You Can't Spell. While explaining the parts of the idea that excite me (the narrator who creates the world as he speaks) he said "Have you seen Bastion?"</p>&#13;

<p>Sure enough, most of the good parts of my idea have been done, and far better than I could have done them. That quite quickly deflated my enthusiasm for the idea! I don't know why I'm writing this really, I guess just to remind myself that if I think I have an interesting and unique idea I should do it before someone else inevitably thinks of the same thing!</p>&#13;
<p>Nevermind, next time...</p>&#13;
<p>(As an aside, Bastion is an excellent game I would highly recommend)</p>
