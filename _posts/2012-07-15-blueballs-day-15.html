<p>Go to <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a> to see the first playable portion of BlueBalls. It's pretty buggy right now (the balls will sit on top of each other rather than bouncing? and sometimes the physics is off when the balls are introduced) but the level can be completed. Go on, try it. It's very simple. The goal is to get the balls from the "in" text to the "out" text. You start in build mode, by clicking "Start" the simulation starts and you can no longer modify the objects in the game, click "Reset" to return to build mode to modify your solution.</p>

<p>Getting to this stage has involved rewriting large chunks of the code which deals with scaling - obviously it's still not complete. Over the first half of next week I want to polish what's there, then spend the last 10 days adding content (items, tools, and levels).</p>

<p>I've also been assured that the graphics are on their way - so hopefully no more google images for graphics soon.</p>

<p>From the outside progress seems to be slow but hopefully much of the work I'm doing now will make it much easier for me to make interesting levels later in development. We'll see. Anyway, <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">check it out</a></p>
