<p>Not as much progress today as I hoped for. I got a little confused about joints and how to make the controls intuitive. I'm probably going to have to replace the way of moving entities around as it's a little unwieldy but I have some other things I want to do first.</p>

<p>First I want to add the ability to glue entities together, which might make the whole control scheme easier (being able to create semi-stable structures). I haven't yet decided if the glue will break with enough force or not.</p>

<p>Then I need to figure out how to have "background" entities. These would be used for, for example, rope holding things together. It needs to be there but you don't want it to block the ball's movement. I need to figure out a way to represent this that won't look out of place or confusing.</p>

<p>So today I got the level loading joints (as you can see by the sphere stuck to the rectangle when you start the tutorial), and I also set up the framework for creating tools. I haven't actually created any tools yet though... but the capability is there for me to do so.</p>

<p>Hopefully I'll get glue working properly tomorrow. Check the game out at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>.</p>
