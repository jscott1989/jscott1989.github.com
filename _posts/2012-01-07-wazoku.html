<p>I've been working at <a href="http://wazoku.com">Wazoku</a> since the start of 2012. The main product is <i>Idea Spotlight</i>, an idea management system which creates communities around ideas and encourages innovation within an organisation</p>

<p>The work varies day to day. Normally there'll be work on <a href="http://www.wazoku.com/ideation/">Idea Spotlight</a>, but also work on <a href="http://www.wazoku.com/competitions/">Competitions</a>, or even writing <a href="https://siliconmilkroundabout.wazoku.com/">an AI competition</a>.

<p>The bulk of the work is in Python using the Django framework, though we also use quite a bit of Coffeescript and some Clojure, which keeps things interesting.</p>
