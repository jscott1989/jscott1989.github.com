<p>I worked at <a href="http://wazoku.com">Wazoku</a> from the beginning of January, 2012 to the end of December, 2012, before leaving to persue <a href="/phd.html">a PhD in Computer Science</a>.</p>

<p>Wazoku's main product is <i>Idea Spotlight</i>, an idea management system which creates communities around ideas and encourages innovation within an organisation</p>

<p>My work there was primarily software development using Python &amp; Javascript. This involved Wazoku Spotlight, The Find Invest Grow Idea Funnel, Wazoku Consultations, and Wazoku Competitions.</p>

<p>The role involved liasing directly with the CEO (and later the product manager) and turning feature requirements into technical requirements. I also performed interviews and made hiring decisions, building and leading a team of 4 developers.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting projects I worked on while at Wazoku was the <a href="http://siliconmilkroundabout.wazoku.com/final_editor">Silicon Milkroundabout coding competition</a> which involved the creation of a web-based javascript coding game in under two weeks. It was an interesting challenge to say the least.</p>
