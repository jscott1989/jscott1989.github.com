<p>Get an email from "Powerhouse Direct Southampton" letting you know how interesting they find your CV and inviting you for an immediate interview? Sorry but your CV isn't THAT impressive...</p>&#13;
<p>The way it works is Powerhouse Direct will invite lots and lots of people to interview (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=powerhouse+direct&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=powerhouse+direct+southampton&amp;oq=powerhouse+direct+southampton&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1g-v3&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i15l3.1030l1981l0l2126l12l2l0l9l9l0l96l188l2l10l0.llsin.&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=f85e188e4be29462&amp;biw=1069&amp;bih=680">just look at the amount of job adverts</a>) and miraculously most of these get hired! that's because the job is 100% commission and you'll be required to sell rubbish products to people door-to-door (for below minimum wage as you're a "contractor"). As such they have a very high turnover of staff.</p>&#13;

<p>Other signs that it's shady: they email from a Gmail address, their website isn't set up, etc. etc. I'd recommend just ignoring them if they invite you to interview.</p>&#13;
<p>Consider this a public service :) Hopefully this can chart on Google results for <a href="/2012/04/15/don-t-work-for-powerhouse-direct.html">Powerhouse Direct</a>.</p>
