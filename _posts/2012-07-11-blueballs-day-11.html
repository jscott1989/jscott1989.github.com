<p>I managed to get simple interaction working today, although I'm still not sure it's right. I welcome any feedback on the control system and ways to improve it. The game is going to be about building things so I feel the current control scheme is too frustrating (with the parts flapping around too much). Check the game out at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a> and let me know.

<p>Apart from that I also got simple level serialization working. There's a lot more to do with this but it can be seen by clicking "Start" (which takes a snapshot of the current state) then messing with the environment a bit, then clicking "Reset" which will restore the previous state.</p>

<p>What should happen is that the initial building stage will have the player putting together their solution to the puzzle, then pressing Play will release the balls and test if the solution gets them to the goal. Pressing reset will return to build mode to work on the solution some more.</p>

<p>I guess the plan for tomorrow is to get joints working in some way - so the solutions can get a little more elaborate, and maybe look into the controls a little more.</p>
