<br />
<br />I'm currently considering purchasing myTumblr as it's the nicest Tumblr client I can see for OSX. Can anyone recommend any others?
<br />
<br />The thing I like about it is that I can open it quickly and write a post with no messing around, it automatically uploads images and everything I need. I'm not concerned about reading tumblr from the client, I just want to be able to post.
<br />
<br />The interface looks a little messy in my opinion though, so other options would be welcomed.<br />
