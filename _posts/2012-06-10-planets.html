<p>Planets is the last game I'm working on as an entry to <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3488014">SA Gamedev VII</a>. The theme is "balls" and though I'm not sure how well my idea matches with the theme, this is the best I could come up with so here we go!</p>

<p>The game focuses heavily on physics, but current experiments show that the making the physics too realistic makes the game impossible to play. I'll need to figure out if I can simplify the physics while keeping the game challenging, or come up with a new idea.</p>

<p>I'm working with <a href="http://alanlongstaff.com/">Alan Longstaff</a> on this game.</p>
