<p>Cognatus is a relational algebra simulator, created for David Nelson as my final year project at the University of Sunderland.</p>

<h3>The idea</h3>

<p>Relational Algebra is an important technology to learn when learning relational database theory, however the learning methods available to teach it leave a lot to be desired. Cognatus is an attempt to allow students to learn in their own time and at their own pace by allowing them to interact with the same databases they have been using throughout university in a graphical way.</p>

<p>Using the graphical interface, the student can generate valid algebra queries and see the SQL equivalent of the algebra. The queries can then be edited and modified to see the results to both the algebra and the SQL.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Drag and drop creation of algebra trees</li>
	<li>Generation of Algebra and SQL (for MySQL and Oracle)</li>
	<li>Multiple tabs for separate connections</li>
	<li>Cross platform (implemented as a standards compliant rich internet application)</li>
	<li>Future enhancements</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of improvements which could be made to Cognatus, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Improved SQL Generation for complicated queries including lots of subqueries and joins (There has been interest expressed in implementing this improvement)</li>
	<li>Relational Calculus</li>
	<li>Load/Save (Partially complete)</li>
	<li>Undo/Redo (Partially complete)</li>
</ul>
