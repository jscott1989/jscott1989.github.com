<p>Seaweed Player is one of my latest projects. It has been in development since my girlfriend had to return to China while sorting out her visa (she has since returned). It allows people over a long distance to watch movies together as if they were in the same room, with synchronised pause/play/rewind/fast forward/etc.</p>

<p>The Mac version is available at <a href="http://seaweedplayer.com/">the Seaweed Player</a> website, and the Windows version is currently in development.</p>

<p>Features to come soon:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Skype integration</li>
	<li>Streaming videos</li>
</ul>
