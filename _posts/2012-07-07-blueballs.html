<p>After my team fell apart on the planned entry <a href="/entropy.html">Entropy</a>, I had to scale back quite significantly and decided that the original idea was unworkable.</p>

<p>Instead, I've decided to work on a puzzle game based around <a href="http://blueballfixed.ytmnd.com/">blue ball machines</a>. That game is named Blue Balls Inc. and is being written in Javascript with jQuery on the client side and Python using Bottle on the server side.</p>

<p>You can play the latest version of the game at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>.</p>
