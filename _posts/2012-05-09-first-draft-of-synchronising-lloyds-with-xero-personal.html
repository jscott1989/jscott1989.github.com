<p>I've recently signed up to <a href="https://personal.xero.com/">Xero Personal</a>Â and was disappointed that there is still no synchronisation with bank accounts. It's promised, but it has been promised for a long timer. So for the time being I've decided to roll my own.</p>&#13;
<p>I started by writing in in Python as that's what I'm most familiar with, but hit a wall when trying to upload to Xero with Python as it required Javascript. For this I changed to casperjs. You need a bit of technical know-how to get this working, and really need to be able to code if you want it work with anything apart from Lloyds TSB, but I thought I'd put it up here incase it helps anyone.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll be signing up for a bank account with The Co-op soon so will be making a synchronisation solution for that, and I'll take the opportunity to re-write the Python part of this into casper so that it's a smoother experience. I'll re-post this code when I do that.</p>&#13;
<p>If anyone has custom synching solutions for other banks please link to them in the comments.</p>&#13;
