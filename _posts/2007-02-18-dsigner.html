<p>First created in VB6 for use by the users of the (sadly now dead) DSMeet.com. It was designed to provide a way to generate and edit decals to be used on Mario Kart DS.</p>

<p>It was recoded in Java and re-released for the (very much still alive) <a href="http://friendcodes.com">Friendcodes.com</a>. Now supporting quite a few different games and a marginally prettier backend DSigner became extremely popular on the official Nintendo NSider forums with hundreds of regular users. When DSigner's popularity began to fade it was open sourced under the GPL.</p>

<p>If you want to see the sort of stuff I did when I was 16 take a look at the <a href="/static/files/DSigner.zip">application</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jscott1989/DSigner">the source code</a>. But beware - I was young and stupid, it's not pretty code!</p>
