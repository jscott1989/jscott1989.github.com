The SA Gamedev competition started a day early!

I used the day to get the basic structures set up (GUI, changing the cursors, etc.) and also managed to find time to start on the basics of creating planets. It's all going fairly well so far except that I had to recode all of the Javascript into c# as NGUI doesn't work well with Javascript.

Another issue is that the free version of NGUI sticks an ugly watermark on the game, but Â£60 is a pretty steep price if this is the only game I ever make with it!

Check out the screenshots, but remember our designer hasn't started work yet.

This will sound like BOOOOOM
