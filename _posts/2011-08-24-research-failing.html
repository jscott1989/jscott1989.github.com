<p>There&rsquo;s like… 2 or 3 weeks left until my dissertation is due and right now things are not going so well.</p>

<p>I'm researching the effects of identity on response to credibility information. To do this I'm presenting test subjects with a mix of credible and non-credible information, and asking them to rate it.</p>

<p>With some of the information I also present expert opinions. Some of these expert opinions have identity associated with them (e.g. &ldquo;John Smith, Oncologist&rdquo;) and some simply identify them as &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I am looking to see if there is a difference between response when there is a) no credibility information, b) anonymous credibility information and c) credibility information from an identified expert.</p>

<p>That part is going… poorly… I'm struggling to find non-credible documents on the subjects of Environmental Science, Politics, and Finance which have experts on Twitter disparaging them. There just aren&rsquo;t enough Ben Goldacre&rsquo;s of the Environmental Science world I guess… but still… I keep going.</p>

<p>Speaking of Ben Goldacre, the second problem I'm having is establishing what the actual credibility of a document should be to compare the subjects' ratings to. So far I've tried contacting some of the experts on Twitter (via email, as Twitter only allows you to direct message people who also follow you) with no responses. I'm now trying to contact people from my university&rsquo;s medical school but I'm not sure how much success I'm going to have there. If by some coincidence a doctor is reading this and would like to help out please get in touch.</p>

<p>If you'd like to help otherwise and be a test subject please click here. If it errors that there are no test setups available then try again later as currently I've got 10/12 subjects for the Health section, and I'm still putting together the setups for the other areas. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)</p>
