<p>I am available for freelance work currently. I have experience with Python, PHP, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Objective-C, and a few other languages. My preference is to work with Python or Javascript but I have no problem working with the others.</p>

<p>I'm most interested in working with interactive web applications, though I also enjoy writing phone apps, and I'm able to work on websites if that's what you need. Take a look at some of the other pages on this site to get a feel for what I'm best at.</p>

<p>My typical rate is Â£250 per day, and if you're interested you can send me an email at <a class="cma" href="jscott.me" title="jonathan">myfirstnameATatATthisdomainDOTdotDOTme</a></p>
