<p><strong>Entropy</strong> was the original game being worked on as an entry to <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3488014">SA Gamedev VII</a>. Unfortunately due to circumstances out of my control this game idea became unworkable after around a week and so development switched to <a href="/blueballs.html">Blue Balls Inc.</a>.

<p>The game originally focused heavily on physics - which is where the tenuous link with the theme was going to come in, however we quickly discovered that realistic planetary physics are more frustrating than fun. The game then changed into a god game at the solar system level. Unfortunately the graphical requirements left me quite out of my depth so the game could not be completed in the alloted time.</p>
