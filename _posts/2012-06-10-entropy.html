<p><strong>Entropy</strong> is the game I'm working on as an entry to <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3488014">SA Gamedev VII</a>. The theme is "balls" and though I'm not sure how well my idea matches with the theme, this is the best I could come up with so here we go!</p>

<p>The game originally focused heavily on physics - which is where the tenuous link with the theme was going to come in, however we quickly discovered that realistic planetary physics are more frustrating than fun. We're now aiming to turn it into a god game at the solar system level.</p>

<p><a href="http://alanlongstaff.com/">Alan Longstaff</a> will be providing the graphics, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4104438/">Josef Gagnier</a> providing narration.</p>
