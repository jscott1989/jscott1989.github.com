<p>I attended <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">the University of Southampton</a> in 2010-2011 to study a MSc in Software Engineering. I finished top of my class with an average of 79% and recieved the <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/3738">Winston Capital prize</a></p>

<p>While there, my dissertation looked at using public Twitter data to improve the accuracy of user judgements of online information (for example, augmenting a website on alternative medicine with the opinions of a medical doctor). I got some interesting results, with the overall result proving my hypothesis correct that peoples' judgements can be improved using this method.</p>

<p>Nothing has come from this research so far, but there's an interesting and useful application there if anyone wants to build it!</p>
