<p>Has it really been almost 15 days since my last update? oops... Well I have been working on the game and changes from the last version (off the top of my head) are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All graphics have been replaced</li>
	<li>Magnets and metal objects are added</li>
	<li>Tools have been removed as I won't have time to make any</li>
	<li>Some sounds have been added</li>
	<li>Introduction text for levels</li>
</ul>

<p>I have ideas for 3 or 4 real levels, which I'll now implement as first priority (as a game with no levels isn't so great!).</p>
<p>After that I need to create a "you have won" screen, stop the pink start screen when viewing replays, finish off the sounds, and tighten up some of the collision boxes.</p>

<p>There's a lot that I wanted to get in the game that I can't do now (lots more object types and effects, level creator, etc.) but if I can get these levels done I think I'm pretty happy with how it turned out considering how busy I've been this month.</p>

<p>A few more days left, you can try the latest version at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">http://blueballs.jscott.me</a></p>
