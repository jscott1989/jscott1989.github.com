<p>Today I made the decision to switch development from Entropy to a simpler game which I can implement by myself. That game is Blue Balls Inc. a puzzle game based on <a href="http://blueballfixed.ytmnd.com/">blue ball machines</a>. The mechanics are not totally worked out yet but I'm hoping to make it so that users can add their own puzzle pieces to the game, and the game will automatically incorporate them into puzzles.</p>

<p>The latest version of the game can be followed at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>. Though so far all I've put together is the basic menu system (all graphics and colour subject to change)</p>
