<p>There was no Day 1 update as I spent the entire day banging my head against this project trying to get planets to orbit the sun correctly. It turned out it was very simple! This is the code:</p>

{% highlight C# %}

void Start () {
	direction = target.transform.position - transform.position;
	cross = Vector3.Cross(Camera.main.transform.forward, direction);
}

void Update () {
	transform.RotateAround(target.position, cross, (0 - orbitSpeed) * Time.deltaTime);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Simple, eh? So the idea is that the planets will orbit predictably as they will always begin their rotation towards the player across the centre of the Sun. This should allow people to accurately place the planets on the correct orbit.</p>

<p>Apart from this I also made the planets destroy each other when they crash (though there's no fancy effects for this yet which will be added soon!), and I started on planet statistics (temperature, climate, resources, etc.). You can see the progress so far below (though for some reason the Unity Web Player is outputting a horrendously low quality version. I need to figure out why).
