<p>I attended <a href="http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/">The University of Sunderland</a> from 2007 to 2010 studying Computing.</p>

<p>While there, I participated in the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2009/06/sunderland_uni_hackday/">Yahoo Hack Challenge</a>, and though my team didn't win any of the prizes, I did receive the award for best individual student, which I was rather proud of.</p>
