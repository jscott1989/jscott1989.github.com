<p>We have graphics! but in the process I broke the Start/Reset functionality. I'll try to restore that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I restructured the game to seperate the physics engine from the rest of the game. This allowed me to finally add a real renderer into the mix. I needed to do this before I could move on to glue so that I could show where glue actually was to see if it was working.</p>

<p>To implement the graphics I have chosen <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS">EaselJS</a> which I haven't had time to look into fully but seems to mix very well with Box2D. I just set the rotation point to be the center of the bitmap, and remember to convert the meters to pixels and radians to degrees and it's easy!</p>

<p>Ideally, by end of day Sunday I want something playable. So that's the goal for this weekend. It might not be fun, and it might not be pretty. But it'll be playable. Fun and pretty can come in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Check the game out at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>. There's a bug which I hope to fix soon where sometimes the graphics are not inline with the physics. If this happens click "Menu" and restart the level.</p>
