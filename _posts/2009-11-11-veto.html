<p>Veto is the result of my annoyance at constantly writing simple validation code for use on Lingscars. The first iteration was a Java inspired (read: overly verbose) validation library named LavaForms.</p>

<p>This was rewritten as a much leaner library named Veto which, as far as I can tell, has never been used by anyone but me... shame. It hasn't been worked on in a while and is pretty much dead, but I do think it was as good a solution as any others available at the time, I just didn't push it enough.</p>

<p>The key feature is that the forms were defined once in PHP, and then validation was performed on both the server and the client (using Javascript). I haven't seen any other frameworks doing this (as of the time of writing this).</p>
