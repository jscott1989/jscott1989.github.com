<p>Not a whole load of progress today. My new Retina Macbook Pro arrived so I was distracted playing with it. I did get a level loader working though. Right now you can create simple circles and rectangles but the format is going to have to change when I want to support joints connecting things together to create complex machines. I'll figure that out when I get to it I suppose.</p>

<p>The level loading is very simple and doesn't reload when the level file changes - that means I need to refresh refresh refresh when I'm working on the levels but I hope this won't matter soon as one of the next things I want to do after getting interaction working is a level editor (which hopefully will be as simple as saving the game state and giving it a name... hopefully)</p>

<p>The game is progressing well, and the image of how it's going to turn out is beginning to form in my mind, which never really happened with the last game. I'm pretty confident something decent will come out this. Hopefully tomorrow I will get around to allowing the player to interact with the scene, then the game might be worth playing with. For now, the very boring level can be viewed at <a href="http://blueballs.jscott.me">blueballs.jscott.me</a>.</p>
