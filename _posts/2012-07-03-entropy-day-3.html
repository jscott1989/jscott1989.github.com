<h2>Changes today:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Planets no longer destroy the sun (that was just silly!)</li>
	<li>Time passes at a fixed rate</li>
	<li>Planets now have names (autogenerated, in future these will be overridable by the player)</li>
	<li>Life can randomly form on planets (right at the start of a year, in future this will happen throughout the year)</li>
	<li>Display population, and record maximum population (for a final score)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing which is actually visible to the player today, so I'm not going to post the application. Hopefully we'll have something more exciting to show tomorrow. Slow and steady progress though.</p>
