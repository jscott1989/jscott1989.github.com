<p>While at University I spent two years working at <a href="http://www.lingscars.com/">LINGsCARS</a>. Though the website looks... interesting don't blame me for that! that was done long before I joined the company.</p>

<p>There are some things there which I am quite proud of though, such as <a href="http://www.lingscars.com/sitemap.php">The live sitemap</a> which was built around the <a href="http://www.whoson.com/">Whoson</a> visitor tracking system by creating a custom API (as it doesn't have one of its own). It was an interesting project.</p>
