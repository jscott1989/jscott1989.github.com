<body>
<strong>We don't store any data related to you or your usage of the app.</strong>

<p>The Western Empires Calculator app operates entirely on your device and doesn't call out to the internet at all. It also doesn't include ads so there's no data leaving your phone even for that.</p>

<p>If this policy ever changes - we'll make that clear the next time you launch the app - before any data leaves your device.</p>
