<p>I'm looking for a job at the moment and recently had a test on Codility.com. I've heard of it before but never had the opportunity to use it for real so I'll take this opportunity to write about it.</p>&#13;
<p>Basically it’s an automated way of vetting people prior to an interview. It’s pretty well known in software that a lot of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">programmers can’t program</a>. I've seen this myself when I was (briefly) involved in hiring a developer for a previous company.</p>&#13;
<p>I like to think of myself as somebody who can, in fact, program, however I did find the challenges, at least with the pressure of a time limit, fairly challenging. I think it’s a very good idea and I did quite enjoy taking part although in this case I think nerves got the better of me and I didn't represent myself as well as I could have.</p>&#13;
<p>The main problem I have with it is that when I write some code that looks like it should work, and it doesn't - it doesn't inform me of the inputs that caused it to fail. This is especially clear during the current <a href="http://codility.com/cert/start/">certification task</a>  where my latest effort is:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>def shortest_adj_seq(A):</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>if len(A) == 0: return 0</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>positions = {}</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>positions[A[len(A) - 1]] = 1</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>for i in range(len(A) - 2, -1, -1):</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>if i &gt; 0 and (A[i - 1]) in positions:</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>l = positions[A[i-1]]</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>else:</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>l = 9999</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span></p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>r = positions[A[i+1]]</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>if l &lt; r:</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>new = l + 1</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>else:</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>new = r + 1</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span></p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>if A[i] not in positions or new &lt; positions[A[i]]:</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>positions[A[i]] = new</p>&#13;
<p><span> </span>return positions[A[0]]</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>It works on the test cases I've created for it but I guess I fail at creating robust test cases. Can anyone point out what is causing this to fail?</p>&#13;
<p>All in all this is a lot more fun than phone interviews asking about HTML standards and I imagine it offers more information for the company (as long as they look at the code and don’t blindly follow the percentages). I definitely hope to come across it in future jobs I apply for.</p>
