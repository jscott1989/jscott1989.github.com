	<h1><a href="/">&larr; Augmenting documents with credibility feedback from twitter</a></h1>
	<blockquote>More people use the internet as a source of information than any other source, yet people generally perform very poorly when judging the credibility of information found online. Worse than this, they do not even know that they perform so poorly and often assume that their credibility judgements are correct. An automated system to assist users with these judgements is required to realise the potential of the web as a high quality knowledge source.<br />There has been previous research in this area which looked at different ways to automate this judgement. One of the more promising studies found expert behaviour to be a big influence on credibility judgements. Their system relied on private browsing data available to them whereas in this paper we look to recreate the effects of this system while using public data available from Twitter. We also investigate if we can exert a bigger influence on credibility judgements by giving identity to the experts.<br />We find that when expert opinions are presented anonymously as in the previous study, the changes in our version of the experiment mean that there is no significant improvement over no opinions at all. When using named experts however, we do see a significant improvement comparable to that found in previous work. We also investigate a number of related findings from the data we collected and make suggestions as to where we see the future of this important area of research.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />University is over! Actually it has been for a little while but I've been too busy to update this blog until now. In late September I submitted my dissertation looking at the effects of augmenting documents with credibility judgements which are scraped from experts on Twitter.
<br />
<br />This was an attempt to reproduce findings by Julia Schwarz and Meredith Morris where they found an overall improvement in the accuracy of user's credibility judgements when they were presented with the behaviour of experts. In our study we used public data taken from Twitter to see if this is viable without accessing private browsing data.
<br />

<br />
<br />Among other things, we found that there was an insignificant improvement when the expert opinions were offered anonymously, and a significant improvement when the identity of the experts was added.
<br />
<br />This leaves open the question of if a simpler representation of the anonymous opinions (closer mimicking the interface in the Schwarz & Morris study) would get different results.
<br />
<br />I hope to be able to upload the full document here at some point in the future. Maybe someone will find it interesting!<br />
