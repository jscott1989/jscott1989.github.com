	<h1><a href="/">&larr; Is it ethical to perform research using public tweets?</a></h1>
	<p>Today I hit a very big problem with my dissertation. A very very big problem…</p>&#13;
<p>Basically I have created my experiment on the assumption that if my application finds a tweet which is useful it can display it as part of the experiment. However, when putting together a submission for the ethics committee I noticed that the authors of these tweets could be considered participants.</p>&#13;
<p>Asking one of my supervisors, he agreed that they are participants which would mean I would need to get individual consent from each author (between 30 and 60). This would be disastrous for my project as while I think it’s unlikely that these users would have a problem with my usage of their data (I do refer to them as “experts”), it’s also unlikely that they would bother to explicitly give me permission.</p>&#13;
<p>This would mean I'd be running an experiment about tweets influencing credibility judgements… without tweets. Not good…</p>&#13;
<p>While researching possible arguments I could use in my defence for my submission to the ethics committee, I found the following two blog posts about the same discussion on this issue, which are interesting: <a href="http://michaelzimmer.org/2010/02/12/is-it-ethical-to-harvest-public-twitter-accounts-without-consent/">Is it Ethical to Harvest Public Twitter Accounts without Consent</a>? and <a href="http://savageminds.org/2010/02/12/mining-twitter-and-informed-consent/">Mining Twitter and Informed Consent</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>If you're interested you should read them yourselves but the part that I'm desperately hoping the ethics committee will agree with is one of the comments which points to the <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">Twitter Terms of Service</a> which state:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).</p>&#13;
<p>You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to make such Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>I feel that tweets should be treated in the same way as a website. I am using 30 web documents in my research and will not be contacting the author of each for consent as they are considered public.</p>&#13;
<p>Should tweets be considered the same as web documents? I hope so… I'll keep you informed with how it goes…</p>
