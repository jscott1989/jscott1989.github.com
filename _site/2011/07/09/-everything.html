<br />I really need to make a proper blog post about my experiences of Google+ but I just have too much going on right now...
<br />
<br />For the time being, here's a cool Chrome plugin which adds the Google+ bar to any website, allowing you to watch for your notifications when you're not on google+. This is quite impressive considering the API hasn't been released yet (come on Google....).

<br />So yeah... take a look...<br />
