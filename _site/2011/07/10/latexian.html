<br />At the minute I'm writing my masters dissertation and decided to save on some of the headaches I went through in the last few days of my undergraduate dissertation with making sure references are formatted correctly, figures and tables are listed, etc. etc. and I decided to use <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.
<br />
<br />If you don't know what LaTeX is, basically it's a typesetting system where the idea is you write the content and let LaTeX take care of ensuring it's formatted correctly for whatever it's needed for. It's pretty much the standard in the scientific community and many journals publish their own style guides in LaTeX format so the author doesn't need to worry about formatting so much.
<br />
<br />I don't have such high ambitions for my dissertation but using LaTeX still saves time with referencing (using <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a>) and such. I've used LaTeX a couple of times before but only ever using a standard text editor and it's been a little bit fiddly having to make it regenerate the output regularly to see how it looks formatted (I know... the point of LaTeX is I shouldn't care... but it makes me feel good to see pretty output!).
<br />
<br />Latexian is an editor designed specifically for working with LaTex, including features such as syntax aware spell checking and even a live preview. This means I can now look at my pretty output as I type instead of taking regular breaks to do so.
<br />
<br />Its $25 so a bit pricey if it's just for a one off dissertation but if you plan to write a number of academic documents I'd highly recommend it. Also take a look at <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a> (free) for managing the references.
<br />
<br />I've now written more in this blog post than I have on my actual dissertation today so I better end it here....<br />
